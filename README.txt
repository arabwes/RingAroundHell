Ring Around HELL

Description:
	A 2D game comprised of a collection of 9 levels that are all Hell-based. 
This idea was inspired by Dante's Inferno's concept of 9 rings of Hell. 
Each ring of Hell has a theme and each of our level has one that is similar
to that of Dante's Inferno's respective ring. With each unique theme, each
level will also have it's own gameplay style. 



Level 1: Side-Scroller dodge-to-survive - Avoid all obstacles and enemies
Level 2: N/A
Level 3: N/A
Level 4: Gambling/Blackjack - You are given an amount of coins, see how many rounds you'll last
Level 5: N/A
Level 6: N/A
Level 7: N/A
Level 8: Find It! - Find the targetted sin amoung the pool of other sins before time runs out.
Level 9: N/A
